However, from time to time you may want to check the <a href="http://mp3diags.blogspot.com/" class="Note">MP3 Diags blog</a>, where announcements about new releases are made.

<a name="linuxNotes">Linux</a>
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
Linux is the development platform (openSUSE, to be more precise), so the program should work best on Linux. The most important requirement is having Qt 4.3.1 (or above), so I expect most Linux distributions from 2007 or newer to be able to compile and run it (perhaps after some tweaks of the build scripts.)
</div>




<div class="NormalText TitleText RegFnt ChpCol1">
<a name="windowsNotes">Windows</a>
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol1">
It took some fiddling with Qt, GCC, and Boost, to get a Windows version working. The first executable crashed several times for no apparent reason. Later I identified a setting that might have caused the crash; version 0.99.02.013 was the first to include a fix. While I didn't experience the crash after that, I don't feel very confident that the problem is gone, so I recommend using Linux instead, if at all possible. At any rate, I did process some 1600 songs with the Windows port to fix issues in the audio part, and then I corrected the ID3V2 tags and added images for 85 of my albums and everything went OK, no crash whatsoever. But, as they say, your mileage may vary. For one thing, there are some reports of random crashes from Windows users, while others are happily using the program.
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol1">
Something that bothers me is a 1-second delay between the time when the frame of a window appears and the time the content of that window is shown properly. This makes MP3 Diags appear as running on some emulator. I (sort of) got used to it, though.
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol1">
I tested a previous version of the executable on XP SP1, XP SP2, XP SP3 and some Vista Home. Currently the build and tests are done on Windows 7 RC.
</div>


<div class="NormalText TitleText RegFnt ChpCol2">
<a name="othersNotes">Others</a>
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
I'm not aware of attempts to compile and run the project on other platforms (xBSD, OS X, ...), but I'd like to know if somebody tried it and what the results were. At any rate, there is a file that only works with GCC or MSVC, so other compilers should fail until that file gets ported. If somebody wants to publish builds, it would probably be a good idea to tell me, so I can add a link to the build for that platform.
</div>


<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
Well, there is <a href="http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/package.php/mp3diags-mac">this page</a> in the Fink Project, so it looks like the program should work on OS X; also, several percent of the visits to the web site are by OS X users. However, I have never heard from any Mac user about their experience with MP3 Diags, so I can't really say that it works there. Or perhaps they would have told me if it didn't ...

In order to compile and run the project, these packages should be installed:

Qt 4.3.1 is the one that was used for development. Something above should be OK too, but there may be some UI glitches, about which <a href="050_feedback.html">I'd like to know</a>.
</div>


<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
If you want to use GCC 4.4 or above, you need Boost 1.37 or later (see <a href="http://bugs.xmms2.xmms.se/view.php?id=2215">http://bugs.xmms2.xmms.se/view.php?id=2215</a>.)
</div>


<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
If you find some other required package, please <a href="050_feedback.html">let me know</a>.
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
To install the program, unpack the surce to some directory and just run <span class="Reference">Install.sh</span> in that directory. Note that double-clicking the script in some file browser may or may not work, depending on the "current directory" being set properly and on whether a terminal window gets opened so you can type the root password to get the executable copied to /usr/local/bin. Other options are to manually run the relevant commands in <span class="Reference">Install.sh</span>, or to compile the project from KDevelop 3.5, if you have it (though you might have to first change the name of qmake and/or the serialization library.) If you don't use <span class="Reference">Install.sh</span>, pay attention to having the right serialization library. I think the default is OK for most platforms, but in some cases the file src/src.pro should have <span class="Reference">LIBS += -lboost_serialization</span> rather than <span class="Reference">LIBS += -lboost_serialization-mt</span>. Running <span class="Reference">Install.sh</span> or just <span class="Reference">AdjustMt.sh</span> sets the correct value.
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
Uninstallation can be done through <span class="Reference">Uninstall.sh</span>. You probably created some data files, and if you are sure you no longer need them you should remove them manually. Note that the data files come in pairs. Although you only specify an ".ini" file when you start the program for the first time (or when you <a href="310_advanced.html">create a new session</a>), two files get created. The ".ini" only stores settings, while the actual data is stored in a file in the same directory and with the same name but with the extension ".dat".

<a name="sourceWindows">Windows</a>
</div>


<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol1">
Since there are <a href="#binWindows">binaries</a> available (both setup.exe and zip archive), it's more convenient to just use them. However, if you really want to build the project yourself, it's not that hard, provided that you have the required libraries. There used to be a build.bat that had to be modified manually, and only worked with MinGW. This is replaced by <span class="Reference">BuildMp3Diags.hta</span>, an HTML / JScript application that allows you to do these:
<ul>
    <li>Build the project using MinGW</li>
    <li>Build the project using Visual Studio</li>
    <li>Create a .pro file that can be open from Qt Creator</li>
    <li>Create a .sln file that can be open from Visual C++</li>
</ul>

First you need to download and perhaps compile the required libraries: Qt, Boost Serialization, and zlib. This step is not covered here. After that is done, download and unpack MP3Diags-QQQVERQQQ.tar.gz from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mp3diags/files/mp3diags-src/MP3Diags-QQQVERQQQ.tar.gz">SourceForge</a> or from <a href="http://web.clicknet.ro/mciobanu/mp3diags/MP3Diags-QQQVERQQQ.tar.gz">my ISP</a>, run <span class="Reference">BuildMp3Diags.hta</span>, fill in the fields, and create the project files or build the program. BuildMp3Diags.hta has more details about this process.
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol1">
If you don't like the idea of some JScript doing things on your hard drive, you can always change the src\src.pro file until it works. And there's another option as well: Sebastian Schuberth made it possible to compile the project with Visual C++ using CMake. You'll need to set BOOST_ROOT and QTDIR, then run CMake-VS2008-Win32.cmd to generate MP3Diags.sln and MP3Diags.vcproj. Since I don't actually use this, the code may fail to compile occasionally, due to missing headers or some other non-GCC issue. Most likely I won't notice these issues until told.

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
The source code may also be downloaded from the Subversion server provided by SourceForge, by going to the <a href="http://mp3diags.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mp3diags/trunk/mp3diags/">SVN Browser</a> and clicking on <a href="http://mp3diags.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mp3diags/trunk/mp3diags.tar.gz?view=tar">Download GNU tarball</a> at the bottom of the page.

Builds created from code from this server are supposed to be of the same quality as official releases. Changes are tested before checking in. (However, occasionally mistakes may be made.)

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
The Subversion repository stores all the tools that are needed to build the project, not just the source code. So you can find there the documentation, installer and build scripts, and desktop integration files. The build scripts can be used as a starting point for creating binary packages for other .rpm- or Debian- based distributions. Before trying to compile on openSUSE 10.3 (and perhaps other distributions), you should run <span class="Reference">AdjustMt.sh</span> or <span class="Reference">Install.sh</span>
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
Note that you may need to set the executable bit for <span class="Reference">AdjustMt.sh</span>, <span class="Reference">Install.sh</span>, and <span class="Reference">Uninstall.sh</span>, at least when downloading the tarball.

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol1">
Since this is my first attempt at creating distributable binaries, I'm not very confident that they are of good quality. One known issue is that they are not signed. Another issue is that the dependecies might not be best (e.g. the package requires some version of a library while most users have a different, incompatible version.) So this is an area where I could use some help, especially in creating binaries for non-openSUSE platforms.
</div>


<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol1">
My hope is that sometime in the future the program will get included in more well-known repositories, and perhaps official distributions, so I don't have to concern myself with building binaries for various platforms. This has already started to happen: MP3 Diags is included in Gentoo and Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala); repositories that have MP3 Diags and are not built by me exist for Debian 5, openSUSE, and Mac OS X.<!--ttto-->

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol1">
For Linux binaries you probably want to install from a repository (or by using 1-Click-Install on openSUSE), rather than install the .rpm or .deb file directly. This way you get new versions automatically.

Normally you should use the repositories rather than the .deb file, so you are notified automatically about updates. Another issue with the .deb files is that the direct links are broken for a while after running a new build (the link is for the old version, which got replaced by the new version.) You can still get a .deb file from the repository, though.
</div>


<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol1">
In my tests, the Ubuntu 9.04 i386 .deb installation was OK except for a warning about the package not being authenticated, because it's not digitally signed. I looked at this and I think I can't sign Ubuntu / Debian packages that are hosted on the openSUSE servers. I might be wrong, though, since I know next to nothing about building .deb files or signing them. However, I'm not going to look any further into this by my own, but merely hope that somebody more experienced would offer to help (or even better, take ownership of the build process, so I don't have to deal with it.) At any rate, the program installs and runs OK if you ignore that warning. You can read about adding repositories on Ubuntu <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu">here</a>. The command I used when prompted for the "APT line" was:

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol1">
Currently the Ubuntu 8.10 and Debian repositories are on a mirror server, so it takes some time for the latest packages to propagate. This is in the hope that new versions will be found automatically by Synaptic. If new versions don't show up as available, please let me know.
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol1">
The repository on the main server uses redirection, which apparently isn't supported by Synaptic (or at least it wasn't until some time ago, because Ubuntu 9.04 works fine with the main server. Maybe the others work too, but I don't have them installed, so I'll just assume that they don't.) Perhaps somebody would like to test if installation and / or automatic updates work for the main repositories for <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/ciobi/xUbuntu_8.10/">Ubuntu_8.10</a> and <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/ciobi/Debian_5.0/">Debian 5.0</a> and then share the results.

Christian Marillat from <a href="http://www.debian-multimedia.org/">http://www.debian-multimedia.org/</a> notified me that he's building MP3 Diags for Debian 5.0. It can be found in the "unstable" branch. Besides the program being built by somebody who actually knows something about building and did it many times before, you can find there binaries for many other platforms in addition to x86 and AMD64. You can download the i386 package from <a href="http://www.debian-multimedia.org/dists/unstable/main/binary-i386/package/mp3diags.php">this page</a>, but you probably want to add the repository, so you are notified automatically about new releases (see the debian-multimedia.org <a href="http://www.debian-multimedia.org/">home page</a> for instructions about how to add the repository.)
