While the <a href="http://mp3diags.blogspot.com/">MP3 Diags blog</a> may be used for reporting issues and sending feedback, there are two forums on SourceForge that are better suited for reporting bugs, making suggestions, requesting information about how some feature works or how something can be done, as well as just share your experience with MP3 Diags:
<ul>
    <li> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=947206">MP3 Diags Open Discussion Forum</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=947207">MP3 Diags Help Forum</a> </li>
</ul>

I strongly prefer the forums, but you can also write me at <img src="email.png" class="ImgNoBorder" align="top" /> (server: inbox.com, name: ciobi.) However, most mail that I receive there from unknown addresses goes straight to the "Spam" folder, so I suggest putting 000 at the beginning of the subject, which greatly increases the likelyhood of a message not to be lost. Also, if you write me, please <b>make sure that my reply won't get thrown out by your spam filter</b>. Currently the email traffic is low enough that I reply in a timely manner to all the messages I get; so if you expect a reply from me and you don't get it, it is because a message was lost. So better just <b>use the forums</b>, which guarantee that neither your messages nor mine are lost.

I used MP3 Diags on my files and they seem OK. If something wrong happens, chances are an assertion failure will be triggered (there are many asserts), which leads to crashing the program, but not to corrupting MP3 files. I tested most features as I implemented them, but subsequent changes made some of the tests irrelevant, and I didn't repeat them, mainly because of lack of time and of the liberal use of asserts, which should catch most errors. When an assertion failure is triggered, a message like this pops up:
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2 GenericSpace">
<img src="050_assert.png" />
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
Should you encounter something similar, it would be a good idea to let me know about it, so I can fix the error that caused it. I need to know at least the file and the line, but what would really help is a reproducible sequence of events that triggers the assert. System information might be relevant as well. So you can simply select and copy the details from the screen, post them on the forum, and perhaps add a few comments that might shed some light on what led to this.
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
Getting the assert window to show up is tricky, so if you find that MP3 Diags just crashes under some circumstance, you may get additional information if you run it from the command line (or redirect its output.)

<div class="FreeNormalText RegFnt ChpCol1">
If for some reason MP3 Diags crashes at startup, you can use the /u parameter to simulate a new install. This doesn't destroy any custom settings, but chances are that you won't be able to use your last session until some newer version of the program implements a fix for whatever caused the crash.
