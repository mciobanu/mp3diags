It is most likely to apply to old files that have 2 audio streams, but even then, the odds of it doing anything good are rather slim (but it shouldn't do anything bad either.) I implemented it first for a test, and I decided to include it after seeing that it was able to fix audio issues in several of my old files. </td>

This is not as meaningless as it might first seem: if the configuration settings indicate some action (i.e. rename, move or erase) to be taken for processed files, then that action will be performed for these files. While the same can be achieved by changing the settings for unprocessed files, this is easier to use when it is executed on a subset of all the files (filtered or selected). </td>

It's probably best for the Xing header to be removed in this case. If the audio is VBR, you may want to try "Repair VBR data" first. </td>

Only the first audio stream is considered; if a file contains more than one audio stream, this should be fixed first. </td>
